# Simple-Interpretive-Language-Compiler
Custom compliler for my custom language (Simple Interpretive Language)

Role: ANTLR compiler constructor, Programming Language Grammar programmer

   The Project is a custom compiler for my custom language (Simple Interpretive Language). The compiler follows my specified language grammar, scans and parses the written program text using the lexer. If the code is valid, the language is interpreted and the desired output is delivered.
   The project showcases all the various aspects of compiler construction and the steps in creating/executing any language per the given grammar.
